# Agents — AI coding agent resources

This folder contains curated resources for AI coding agents used by the project.

- `skills/` — task-focused instructions the agent can execute (small, re-usable).
- `workflows/` — multi-step processes and rules for common activities (define, plan, implement, document features).
- `references/` — project-specific documentation and dependency notes that augment official docs.

See `MANIFEST.md` for discovery rules.
