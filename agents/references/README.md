# References

References provide project-specific documentation that augments official docs. Use references to capture:

- Dependency notes and version constraints.
- Internal conventions and rationale for chosen libraries.
- Examples, caveats, and links to external docs.

Suggested layout:

- `references/dependencies.md` — inventory of key dependencies and project notes.
- `references/conventions.md` — internal coding or architectural conventions.
