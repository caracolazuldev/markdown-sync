# Conventions

Project-specific conventions and rationale to augment upstream docs.

- Naming: feature branches use `feature/` prefix; bugfixes `fix/`.
- Formatting: follow `gofmt` and repository lint rules.
- Tests: prefer table-driven tests for mapping logic; include fixtures in `docs/examples/`.

If you need to record a convention change, open an issue and update this file.
